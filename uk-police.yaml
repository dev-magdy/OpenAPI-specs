  title: UK Police - OpenAPI 3.0
  description: |-
    The API provides a rich data source for information related to UK Police activities.

    ### Parameters:
      - The `date` parameter takes date in the format (YYYY-MM). It limits results to a specific month. The latest month will be shown by default if omitted.
      - The `poly` parameter takes lat/lng pairs which define the boundary of the custom area in this format '[lat],[lng]:[lat],[lng]:[lat],[lng]'. The first and last coordinates need not be the same. If a custom area contains more than 10,000 crimes, the API will return a 503 status code.
      - Crimes, stop-andsearches, and outcomes are mapped to specific locations on the map. Valid IDs are returned by some methods which return location information. Use these ids for `location_id` parameter.
