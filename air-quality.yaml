  description: |
    Open-Meteo Air Quality offers free pollutants and pollen forecast in 11 km resolution for open-source developers and non-commercial use. No API key is required.
    The `hourly` parameter takes the list of variables to return in the response. Possible values are:

        - 'ammonia'
      + Aerosol optical depth at 550 nm of the entire atmosphere to indicate haze
        - 'aerosol_optical_depth'

        - 'dust'
      + UV index considering clouds and clear sky:

      summary: 5 day air quality forecast for coordinates
      description: |
        This endpoint accepts a geographical coordinate, and returns a list of weather variables and responds with a JSON hourly air quality forecast for 5 days. Time always starts at 0:00 today.
        Forecast is based on the 11 kilometer CAMS European air quality forecast and the 40 kilometer CAMS global atmospheric composition forecasts. The European and global domain are not coupled and may show different forecasts.
